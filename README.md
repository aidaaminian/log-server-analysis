# Log Server Analysis
Log analysis is the process of making sense of computer-generated log messages, also known as log events, audit trail records, or simply logs. Most businesses are required to archive and analyze logs of their websites requests from their clients as part of their compliance regulations. 

They must regularly perform system log monitoring and analysis to search for errors, anomalies, or suspicious or unauthorized activity that deviates from the norm. Log analysis allows them to re-create the chain of events that led up to a problem and effectively troubleshoot it.
